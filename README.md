# Projects
Various projects that I have undertaken individually or as a group.

The first is about planetary motion, which addresses and solves 7 questions about our solar system visually. There are 4 GIFs that I made, showing the different
shapes that the orbits can take. 
This project was a group endevour for my Mathematical Programming module.
